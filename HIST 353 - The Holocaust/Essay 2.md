#### Assignment: 
Reflect on the relationship between dehumanization, desexualization, surveillance, and power from the perspective of victims, perpetrators, and collaborators.

## Introduction
The Holocaust represented a calculated assault by Nazi Germany aimed primarily at Jews but also targeting multiple other marginalized groups, systematically using dehumanization, desexualization, and invasive surveillance as methods of exerting control and dominance. This historiographical essay explores the Holocaust from the perspectives of victims, perpetrators, and collaborators to reveal how each group was implicated in or affected by practices intended to strip individuals of their humanity and dignity. The narrative traces experiences ranging from the intimate humiliation inflicted upon Jewish women in ghettos and camps to the clinical brutality of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and from the complicity of collaborators to the ideologically driven policies of Nazi authorities. These experiences underscore the intersection of sexual violence, omnipresent surveillance, and racial animosity within the Nazis' broader framework of oppression. Chronological developments illustrate how attacks on personal modesty, cultural identity, and private life were deliberately deployed, particularly targeting observant Jews whose religious and cultural dignity was directly violated. Survivor testimonies and historical analyses emphasize that such violations were instrumental in the Nazi strategy of degradation and terror. By weaving together these perspectives, it's possible to highlight the lived realities of those subjected to Nazi brutality but also reflects on the evolving scholarship that continues to bring these narratives into clearer focus, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Holocaust’s complex history and memory.

## The Nazi Machinery: Dehumanization, Sexual Violence, and Surveillance during the Holocaust
Victims of the Nazi regime endured relentless efforts to strip away their humanity and identity. Upon entering ghettos or concentration camps, Jews were subjected to processes that intentionally dehumanized and desexualized them. Women, in particular, recount the trauma of being forced to undress and having their hair shaved off by male guards or even fellow prisoners. Survivor Rena Kornreich recalled that Jewish women in Auschwitz were periodically shorn of all body hair by men (occasionally even by their own relatives) a practice she found profoundly degrading: “We are young women, virgins; it is not in our religion to bare ourselves even in front of our husbands. [...] This is not life-threatening, but it is degrading. One more degrading thing they make us do.” This forced nudity and exposure violated deeply held norms of modesty and constituted an assault on religious and cultural dignity no less than on personal privacy. Another survivor, Dr. Gisella Perl, referred to the camp “beauty parlor”, an ironic term she coined to describe the admission process at Auschwitz, where the true purpose, she explained, was “to deprive [women] of even their last remnants of beauty, freshness, and human appearance.”. Such acts were, as Perl observed, “typical Nazi jokes” devised to humiliate the victims and make their “short remaining life-span” utterly miserable.
Sexual violence itself was also wielded as a tool of terror. Even though Nazi racial laws forbade sexual relations with Jews, German soldiers and local auxiliaries did rape Jewish women with impunity during the genocide. As feminist writer Susan Brownmiller observed in 1975, rape was deemed a “perfectly logical” tool within the Nazi framework of domination and a way for a German man to prove himself a Übermensch or “Superman” through conquering a Jewish woman. Even the official ban on sexual relations with Jews (to prevent Rassenschande, or “race defilement”) did little to protect Jewish women, since genocidal chaos provided cover for such crimes. In fact, sexual sadism often accompanied genocidal killings. During early massacres in Eastern Europe, for example, German-led units singled out Jewish girls for gang rapes and torture in front of their families, taking advantage of their victims’ utter defenselessness. In ghettos under Nazi occupation, public rapes were sometimes carried out to further dehumanize not only the individual victim but the entire Jewish community, reinforcing a terrorized sense of powerlessness. Frieda Forme, a Jewish survivor from Lithuania recounted how occupying soldiers and collaborators took a perverse interest in young women’s purity, specifically to one of her friends, Sheina: discovering a virgin was like finding a “rare and beautiful feast” for them, and those who resisted rape were brutalized and left for dead. Victims like this witness attested that such violations were “worse…than death,” illustrating how sexual assault was intended to annihilate a person’s spirit even before their body was destroyed. In these ways, Nazis and their accomplices weaponized women’s sexuality and bodies against them, seeking to erase femininity, agency, and dignity as part of the broader genocidal project.

This deliberate dehumanization of victims by Nazis and their accomplices was not arbitrary, but rather, they served as a clear and strategic purpose: to strip away victims' identities, making it psychologically easier for perpetrators to enact violence without moral inhibition. From the regime’s top architects down to ordinary soldiers and policemen, there was a pervasive view of Jews (and other targets) as subhuman creatures to be eradicated. This mindset was reinforced by years of propaganda that depicted Jews as vermin or diseases, making it psychologically easier for perpetrators to abuse and kill without remorse. In practice, dehumanization took many forms: from referring to people by numbers or derogatory epithets, to cruel rituals that mocked and degraded. For example, SS guards in camps would force prisoners to perform absurd, painful tasks or endure public humiliation, all intended to erase individuality and assert the Überlegenheit (superiority) of the oppressor. The link between ideology and action is evident in the behavior of units like Reserve Police Battalion 101, a group of middle-aged German policemen tasked with massacring Jews in occupied Poland. On July 13, 1942, the men of Battalion 101 were ordered to shoot the entire Jewish community of Józefów (including women, children, and the elderly), an order given with explicit dehumanizing language that cast the victims as dangerous enemies. Their commander, Major Wilhelm Trapp, acknowledged the gravity of the task and even permitted any man who “didn’t feel up to it” to step aside, but only a dozen out of approximately 500 men took this offer. Major Trapp itself was not present during the massacre: he remained in Józefów because “he allegedly could not bear the sight.” Although Trapp appeared tormented by profound guilt, he nonetheless carried out the orders with diligence, justifying his actions with the familiar refrain that “[...] orders are orders.”
 The vast majority of Police Battalion 101 proceeded to round up and execute defenseless civilians at point-blank range. Testimonies reveal that some policemen justified the murder of children by constructing a perverse rationale: if a child could not survive without its mother, then killing the child alongside (or even instead of) the mother was seen as an act of mercy. One account recalls a policeman deliberately targeting children, explaining that since the mothers were being shot anyway, it was more “humane” to also shoot the child, thereby sparing it a life of inevitable suffering. Historian Christopher Browning, in his study Ordinary Men, concluded that these were not fanatical SS men but average Germans were capable of such atrocities due to a mix of conformity, careerism, and desensitization: once the killing started, peer pressure and obedience outweighed moral hesitation. Yet other scholars have argued that hatred played a more direct role. Daniel Goldhagen, for instance, contends that the men of Battalion 101 were willing executioners driven primarily by virulent antisemitism. From the perpetrators’ perspective, then, extreme violence became normalized through a shared belief system that denied the humanity of the victim. Whether out of duty or ideological fervor, those who committed genocide rationalized their actions as necessary and even honorable – a perverse inversion of morality enabled by dehumanizing the people they oppressed.
Surveillance and the regimentation of daily life were equally vital components of the perpetrators’ exercise of power. The Nazi state established an atmosphere in which victims felt they were under constant watch, leaving little room for resistance or even private solace. In pre-war Germany, Jews were acutely aware that their neighbors or customers might be informants for the Gestapo. Ordinary activities like gathering for a holiday or study group became perilous because “when groups of Jews gathered in private homes, they feared that they were being watched”, as historian Marion Kaplan notes. Local Nazi block wardens and paid informants monitored every neighborhood, ensuring that even trivial activities or the lighting of Sabbath candles might be reported to authorities. Under Nazi rule, all Jewish communal life was suspect, driving victims to hide even the most innocuous social interactions. This invasive scrutiny intensified once Jews were confined to ghettos and camps. Ghetto residents lived under the eyes of German authorities and their appointed Jewish police at all times – a divide-and-conquer strategy that conscripted some victims to monitor and control others. Any sign of dissent could be swiftly reported and brutally punished, instilling a deep fear and distrust within the oppressed community. In concentration camps, the surveillance was both direct and indirect: armed SS guards in watchtowers observed every move, while prisoner-functionaries (kapos and blockälteste) enforced internal discipline. Prisoners had no privacy; even intimate acts like using the latrine or showering occurred under the gaze of others, compounding their humiliation. Nazi officials understood that omnipresent surveillance sapped prisoners’ morale and deterred revolt. As Primo Levi and other survivors later observed, the system was designed to make inmates feel utterly powerless – they were seen and treated as objects to be managed, numbered, and disposed of at will. By turning the captive population into a society of watchers and the watched, the perpetrators maximized their control. Surveillance was not passive observation, but an active weapon of tyranny: it isolated individuals, destroyed mutual trust, and ensured that the Nazi hierarchy of power remained unchallenged even amid thousands of prisoners. Over time, prisoners internalized this surveillance, learning to anticipate punishment and even policing their own behavior and each other – a psychological victory for the Nazis’ regime of control. In sum, the perpetrators’ perspective on surveillance was that of a necessary tool to maintain dominance – a complement to raw violence that helped secure their oppressive order every hour of every day.
The Holocaust perpetrators did not act alone; they frequently found willing collaborators among local populations in occupied territories. These collaborators (drawn from various ethnic and political backgrounds) participated in dehumanization and violence, sometimes out of ideological agreement and other times for personal gain or under duress. In Eastern Europe, for example, local militia and police often assisted the German SS and Einsatzgruppen in identifying, humiliating, and massacring Jews. Some pogroms were initiated by neighbors before Germans even arrived, fueled by long standing antisemitism and opportunism. Local collaborators could be exceptionally brutal: eyewitnesses in Lithuania and Ukraine recalled that it was often local auxiliaries who carried out rapes and torture during early round-ups, taking sadistic pleasure in the power over their former neighbors. Nazi authorities leveraged this local zeal. Without auxiliary help, the scale of genocide would have been difficult to achieve with German manpower alone. One striking case was the camp at Lety in Czechoslovakia, where a detainment camp for Roma was operated by Czech guards under Nazi supervision. Conditions in Lety were atrocious as prisoners were beaten, starved, and forced into hard labor, enabled by the Czech camp staff that intentionally led to a shocking mortality rate among the inmates. Likewise, in occupied Poland and the Baltic states, auxiliary police units not only guarded ghettos but actively hunted down Jews in hiding. They shared in the spoils of plundered Jewish property and in the empowerment that came from enacting the conqueror’s will. For these collaborators, adopting the Nazi practice of dehumanizing the victims served to justify their betrayal of former community members. Labeling Jews or Roma as subhuman or traitorous made it easier for collaborators to rationalize participation in atrocities. Yet it is important to note that not all collaboration stemmed from genuine conviction; in some cases, individuals were coerced or pressured, but even coerced collaborators contributed to the machinery of persecution once they were in those roles.
A different and more tragic kind of collaboration was forced upon some victims themselves. Under extreme coercion, certain Jews were compelled to act as functionaries within the Nazi system, blurring the line between oppressor and oppressed. In the ghettos, the Germans appointed Jewish councils (Judenräte) and Jewish police units to administer daily affairs and enforce German orders. These Jews faced horrific dilemmas: if they did not obey orders to, say, deliver a quota of people for “resettlement” (in reality, deportation to death camps), the Nazis would kill many more indiscriminately. Trying to mitigate harm, they often complied with directives, unintentionally facilitating the Nazi goals. For instance, when a ghetto leader like Chaim Rumkowski in Łódź agreed to hand over children and the elderly for deportation, believing it might save the rest of the community, he was in fact participating in the dehumanization process – reducing lives to bargaining chips. Such actions, even if made under duress, had the effect of extending Nazi surveillance and control into the heart of the Jewish community, as victims became instruments of their own people's torment. In concentration camps, a similar dynamic unfolded. The SS appointed certain prisoners as kapos, block supervisors, or camp trustees, giving them meager privileges in exchange for overseeing fellow prisoners with brutal discipline. Some of these prisoner-functionaries were themselves Jewish or political prisoners trying to survive; others were common criminals who relished the power they wielded. Either way, the camp hierarchy ensured that cruelty trickled down. A kapo might beat those in his barracks to impress his SS masters, or a Jewish ghetto policeman might turn a blind eye to abuse in order to protect his own family. Survivor Primo Levi famously described this moral quagmire as a “gray zone” in which the difference between victim and collaborator became blurred under monstrous pressures. Many who were coerced into such roles suffered lasting guilt and shame, recognizing how the system had used them to violate their own ethical norms. From the Nazis’ perspective, this involuntary collaboration was a cunning strategy: it outsourced the work of dehumanization and surveillance to the victims themselves, fracturing solidarity and deepening the reach of Nazi power. In the end, whether collaboration was voluntary or forced, it demonstrates how thoroughly the Nazi regime weaponized dehumanization and control – corrupting human relationships and exploiting the survival instinct to extend its dominion.
Conclusion
The histories of victims, perpetrators, and collaborators in the Holocaust reveal how dehumanization, desexualization, and surveillance were not ancillary tactics but core instruments of Nazi power. For the victims, being treated as less than human – stripped naked, violated, constantly watched – inflicted deep physical and spiritual wounds that outlasted the war. For the perpetrators, denying their victims’ humanity made genocide feasible and psychologically palatable; it allowed ordinary men and women to commit extraordinary crimes under the guise of duty, ideology, or even camaraderie. Collaborators inhabited a tenuous space in between, their perspectives ranging from enthusiastic participation to anguished complicity. In all cases, the Nazi strategy was devastatingly effective: by attacking people’s dignity, sexuality, and privacy, it aimed to destroy not just bodies but also cultures, faith, and identity. Scholarly understanding of these dynamics has grown over time. Early accounts often shied away from topics like sexual violence or the moral gray zones of cooperation, but later research and testimonies – from pioneering feminist analyses to survivor memoirs – have illuminated the full extent of how power was wielded on an intimate level. Ultimately, reflecting on these perspectives underscores that the Holocaust was fought not only in gas chambers and battlefields, but in the realm of human intimacy and integrity. The calculated assault on modesty, sexuality, and trust was a fundamental part of the Nazi attempt to annihilate the Jewish people, and it remains a stark reminder of how thoroughly tyranny can pervert social relations. By examining these harrowing experiences through multiple lenses, we acknowledge the resilience of those who endured, the ideology of those who aggressed, and the tragic choices of those caught in between – and we ensure that the lessons of this dark chapter of history are neither forgotten nor simplified.
